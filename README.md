# Subitop_GRANADA


Support git-hub repository for my poster in TopoEurope Conference, Granada, May 2019. It contains the animations correspondng to the figures on the right side. *Apparently the gif does not show up on mobile automatically, you can either download them or switch your internet browser to computer mode. (You can also call me and I'll have my computer.)*
